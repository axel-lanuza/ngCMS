## How to install

Copy the folder to any location in your computer.
It has two apps first `Angular App` and second one is `ExpressJS` for api. You need to install both the app and both should be running simultaneously to work this cms. You also need to modify apiUrl and appUrl inside environments files and in env.js file. 
Please note env.js file overwrites the environment variables.

Go to manageACL and run `npm install` to install its dependencies. 
Then run `ng serve`.
Then Open another terminal and Go to the api and run `npm install` then run the command
`node server.js`

That's it.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` or `ng g c component-name --no-spec` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
